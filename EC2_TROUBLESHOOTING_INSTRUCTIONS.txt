# EC2 Troubleshooting Instructions

Since you're having trouble finding the scripts on your EC2 server, here's a direct approach to troubleshoot the 502 and 403 errors:

## Option 1: Copy and Paste the Script Directly

1. SSH into your EC2 server:
   ```
   ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@evanjamesofficial.com
   ```

2. Create a new script file on the EC2 server:
   ```
   nano troubleshoot.sh
   ```

3. Copy and paste the ENTIRE content of the `scripts/ec2-troubleshoot.sh` file from your local machine into the nano editor on the EC2 server.

4. Save the file (Ctrl+O, then Enter) and exit nano (Ctrl+X).

5. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x troubleshoot.sh
   ```

6. Run the script with sudo to ensure it can check and fix all issues:
   ```
   sudo ./troubleshoot.sh
   ```

## Option 2: View the Script in VSCode and Copy Manually

1. Open the `scripts/ec2-troubleshoot.sh` file in VSCode.
2. Select all content (Ctrl+A) and copy it (Ctrl+C).
3. Paste it into a new file on your EC2 server as described in Option 1.

## Option 3: Use SCP to Upload the Script

If you have SSH access configured correctly, you can upload the script directly:

```
scp -i your-key.pem scripts/ec2-troubleshoot.sh ubuntu@evanjamesofficial.com:~/troubleshoot.sh
```

Then SSH into your server and run:
```
sudo chmod +x ~/troubleshoot.sh
sudo ~/troubleshoot.sh
```

## What the Script Does

The troubleshooting script will:

1. Set up swap space if needed (to prevent memory issues)
2. Check PM2 processes and restart them if needed
3. Verify application directory structure and permissions
4. Examine Nginx configuration for common issues
5. Check for port availability and service status
6. Provide detailed logs and next steps for resolution

After running the script, check the log file it creates for detailed information about any issues it found and fixed.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### For 502 Bad Gateway (Backend API):

- Backend service not running or crashed
- Incorrect Nginx proxy configuration
- Missing or incorrect backend environment variables
- Database connection issues

### For 403 Forbidden (Frontend):

- File permission issues (fixed by the script)
- Incorrect Nginx root directory configuration
- Missing or incomplete frontend build
- Incorrect file ownership

The script will attempt to fix these issues automatically when run with sudo.
