# [ARCHIVED] Strapi Integration Best Practices Checklist

> **Note**: This document has been archived. Please refer to the new consolidated [Integration Guide](../../../docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for the most up-to-date information.

## 0. Cursor-Specific Considerations

### Environment File Handling
- [ ] Create template files for sensitive configurations:
  - [ ] `.env.template` for environment variables
  - [ ] `config.template.js` for configuration files
  - [ ] `secrets.template.json` for sensitive data
- [ ] Document required environment variables:
  - [ ] List all required variables
  - [ ] Document expected values
  - [ ] Note any dependencies between variables
- [ ] Create setup instructions for local development:
  - [ ] Steps to create `.env` from template
  - [ ] Required API keys and credentials
  - [ ] Local development URLs

### File Access Strategy
- [ ] Implement alternative access methods:
  - [ ] Use `read_file` tool for viewing files
