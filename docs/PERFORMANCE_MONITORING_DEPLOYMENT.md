# Performance Monitoring Deployment Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide for deploying the performance monitoring implementation to production after successful local testing.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to production, ensure:

1. You have completed all tests in the [Performance Monitoring Testing Plan](PERFORMANCE_MONITORING_TESTING_PLAN.md)
2. You have fixed any issues discovered during testing
3. You have appropriate access to the production environment
4. You have a backup of the production environment

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment

#### 1.1 Configuration Review

Before deploying, review the performance monitoring configuration for production:

```javascript
// backend/src/middlewares/performanceMonitor.js
// Ensure these settings are appropriate for production

const options = {
  // Log all requests with performance data (consider setting to false in production)
  logPerformance: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? false : true,
  
  // Track slow requests
  trackSlowRequests: true,
  
  // Threshold in ms to consider a request "slow" (higher in production)
  slowThreshold: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 1000 : 500,
  
  // Send performance data to Sentry (enable in production)
  sendToSentry: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  
  // Skip monitoring for certain paths
  skipPaths: ['/health', '/_health', '/favicon.ico', '/documentation']
};
```

#### 1.2 Deployment Process

1. **Prepare the deployment package**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the backend code** using your established deployment process (e.g., SSH, CI/CD pipeline, etc.)

3. **Update middleware configuration** in production:
   - Ensure `backend/config/middlewares.js` includes the performance monitoring middleware
   - Verify the middleware is in the correct position in the middleware stack

4. **Restart the Strapi server**:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart strapi
   ```

5. **Verify deployment**:
   - Check the server logs for any errors related to the performance monitoring middleware
   - Make a test request to verify the middleware is functioning
   - Access the performance metrics endpoint with admin credentials to verify it's working

### 2. Frontend Deployment

#### 2.1 Configuration Review

Before deploying, review the frontend performance monitoring configuration:

```javascript
// frontend/services/performanceMonitoring.js
// Ensure these settings are appropriate for production

const config = {
  // Enable performance monitoring in production
  enabled: true,
  
  // Log performance data to console (consider setting to false in production)
  logToConsole: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? false : true,
  
  // Send performance data to Sentry
  sendToSentry: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  
  // Thresholds for slow operations (in ms)
  thresholds: {
    pageLoad: 3000,
    apiRequest: 1000,
    resourceLoad: 500,
    interaction: 300
  }
};
```

#### 2.2 Deployment Process

1. **Prepare the deployment package**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the frontend code** using your established deployment process (e.g., SSH, CI/CD pipeline, etc.)

3. **Restart the Next.js server**:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart nextjs
   ```

4. **Verify deployment**:
   - Check the browser console for any errors related to the performance monitoring service
   - Navigate through the site to verify performance monitoring is working
   - Check Sentry for performance-related events

### 3. Sentry Configuration

Ensure Sentry is properly configured to handle performance monitoring data:

1. **Update Sentry project settings**:
   - Log in to your Sentry dashboard
   - Go to Project Settings > Performance
   - Enable performance monitoring
   - Set appropriate sample rates and thresholds

2. **Create performance alerts**:
   - Go to Alerts > Create Alert
   - Create alerts for slow API requests, page loads, etc.
   - Configure notification channels (email, Slack, etc.)

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying to production, perform these verification steps:

1. **Backend Verification**:
   - Make several API requests to different endpoints
   - Check the logs for performance data
   - Access the performance metrics endpoint to verify data is being collected
   - Verify slow requests are being detected and reported to Sentry

2. **Frontend Verification**:
   - Navigate through the site and perform common user actions
   - Check the browser console for performance logs (if enabled)
   - Verify performance data is being sent to Sentry
   - Check that slow page loads and API requests are being detected

3. **Sentry Verification**:
   - Check the Sentry dashboard for performance data
   - Verify performance alerts are working
   - Check that performance context is included in error reports

### 5. Monitoring and Maintenance

After successful deployment, implement these monitoring and maintenance practices:

1. **Regular Performance Review**:
   - Schedule regular reviews of performance metrics
   - Identify slow endpoints and optimize them
   - Monitor memory usage and resource consumption

2. **Alert Tuning**:
   - Adjust alert thresholds based on real-world data
   - Reduce false positives by fine-tuning alert conditions
   - Ensure alerts are actionable and not too noisy

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update documentation with any changes made during deployment
   - Document common performance issues and their solutions
   - Keep configuration examples up-to-date

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after deployment, follow this rollback plan:

### Backend Rollback

1. **Remove the performance monitoring middleware**:
   - Edit `backend/config/middlewares.js`
   - Remove or comment out the performance monitoring middleware
   - Restart the Strapi server

2. **Remove the performance metrics API endpoints**:
   - Disable or remove the performance controller and routes
   - Restart the Strapi server

### Frontend Rollback

1. **Disable the performance monitoring service**:
   - Edit `frontend/services/performanceMonitoring.js`
   - Set `enabled: false` in the configuration
   - Rebuild and redeploy the frontend

2. **Remove performance tracking from the API client**:
   - Edit `frontend/services/api.js`
   - Remove the performance tracking code
   - Rebuild and redeploy the frontend

## Conclusion

By following this deployment guide, you should be able to safely deploy the performance monitoring implementation to production. Remember to monitor the system closely after deployment to catch any issues early and ensure the performance monitoring system itself doesn't negatively impact application performance.
