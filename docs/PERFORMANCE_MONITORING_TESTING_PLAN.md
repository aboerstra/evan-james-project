# Performance Monitoring Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing plan for the performance monitoring implementation before deploying to production.

## 1. Local Environment Setup

### Backend Setup
1. Start the Strapi backend in development mode:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run develop
   ```

2. Verify the performance monitoring middleware is loaded:
   - Check the startup logs for any errors related to the performance monitoring middleware
   - Confirm the middleware is registered in the correct order

### Frontend Setup
1. Start the Next.js frontend in development mode:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the browser console and verify:
   - No errors related to the performance monitoring service
   - The performance monitoring initialization message appears

## 2. Backend Testing

### Middleware Functionality
1. **Basic Functionality Test**
   - Make several API requests to different endpoints
   - Check the backend logs for performance data
   - Verify request counts and response times are being tracked

2. **Slow Request Detection**
   - Create a temporary endpoint that includes a deliberate delay:
     ```javascript
     // In a test controller
     async testSlowRequest(ctx) {
       await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
       ctx.body = { message: 'Slow response test' };
     }
     ```
   - Make a request to this endpoint
   - Verify the slow request is logged with appropriate warning level
   - Check that Sentry captures the slow request (if sendToSentry is enabled)

3. **Error Handling**
   - Create a temporary endpoint that throws an error:
     ```javascript
     // In a test controller
     async testError(ctx) {
       throw new Error('Test error for performance monitoring');
     }
     ```
   - Make a request to this endpoint
   - Verify the error is properly handled and performance is still tracked
   - Check that the status code is correctly recorded

### Performance Metrics API
1. **Metrics Endpoint Security**
   - Attempt to access `/api/performance/metrics` without authentication
   - Verify the request is rejected with 401 Unauthorized
   - Access with admin credentials and verify successful response

2. **Metrics Data Accuracy**
   - Make a series of requests to various endpoints
   - Access the metrics endpoint and verify:
     - Request counts match the requests made
     - Endpoints are correctly identified
     - Response times are reasonable
     - Method and status code counts are accurate

3. **Reset Functionality**
   - Access the metrics endpoint to get current metrics
   - Make a POST request to `/api/performance/reset`
   - Access the metrics endpoint again and verify counters are reset

## 3. Frontend Testing

### Performance Monitoring Service
1. **Initialization Test**
   - Check browser console for initialization message
   - Verify no errors during initialization
   - Check that the service is properly initialized in both development and production builds

2. **Page Load Metrics**
   - Navigate to different pages in the application
   - Use browser DevTools to verify performance metrics are being collected
   - Check console for page load performance logs

3. **API Request Tracking**
   - Make various API requests through the UI (e.g., load albums, submit contact form)
   - Verify API request performance is tracked in the console
   - Check that slow requests are properly identified

4. **Resource Loading Metrics**
   - Load pages with various resources (images, scripts, etc.)
   - Verify resource loading performance is tracked
   - Check that slow resource loads are properly identified

5. **User Interaction Metrics**
   - Perform various user interactions (clicks, form submissions, etc.)
   - Verify interaction performance is tracked
   - Check that slow interactions are properly identified

### Integration with API Client
1. **API Client Performance Tracking**
   - Make API requests using the API client
   - Verify the startTime and endTime are properly recorded
   - Check that the performance data is passed to the performance monitoring service

2. **Error Handling**
   - Trigger API errors (e.g., by disconnecting from the network)
   - Verify performance is still tracked for failed requests
   - Check that the error status is correctly recorded

## 4. Sentry Integration Testing

### Backend Integration
1. **Slow Request Alerts**
   - Configure a low slowThreshold to trigger alerts
   - Make requests that exceed this threshold
   - Verify alerts are sent to Sentry with appropriate tags and context

2. **Error Context**
   - Trigger API errors
   - Verify performance context is included in Sentry error reports

### Frontend Integration
1. **Slow Page Load Alerts**
   - Configure a low threshold for slow page loads
   - Simulate slow page loads (e.g., by throttling network in DevTools)
   - Verify alerts are sent to Sentry with appropriate tags and context

2. **Performance Data in Error Reports**
   - Trigger JavaScript errors
   - Verify performance context is included in Sentry error reports

## 5. Performance Impact Testing

### Backend Performance Impact
1. **Throughput Testing**
   - Use a tool like Apache Bench or wrk to make multiple concurrent requests
   - Compare throughput with and without performance monitoring
   - Verify the impact is minimal (less than 5% degradation)

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Monitor memory usage during extended operation
   - Verify no memory leaks from the performance monitoring middleware
   - Check that memory usage remains stable over time

### Frontend Performance Impact
1. **Page Load Time**
   - Measure page load times with and without performance monitoring
   - Verify the impact is minimal (less than 100ms additional load time)

2. **JavaScript Execution**
   - Use browser DevTools Performance panel to measure JavaScript execution time
   - Compare with and without performance monitoring
   - Verify the impact is minimal

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Monitor memory usage in the browser
   - Verify no memory leaks from the performance monitoring service
   - Check that memory usage remains stable over time

## 6. Security Testing

### API Endpoint Security
